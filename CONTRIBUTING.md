## 🧭 General Guidelines

- **Use GitHub Issues** to report bugs or propose features
- **Start a Discussion** for larger ideas or questions
- **Open a Pull Request** once you've confirmed your work aligns with project direction
- **Keep things modular and maintainable** — if you're not sure how to structure something, ask!
- **Orient your code on existing examples**, and feel free to suggest a standard if it makes things clearer

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Please try to follow the general logic of the existing code when submitting PRs.

We encourage contributors to leave comments or open Discussions when proposing structural or organizational changes.

## 🧾 Issue & PR Best Practices

**For Issues:**
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide a concise explanation of the problem or idea
- Include reproduction steps or example scenarios if it's a bug
- Add screenshots or logs if helpful

**For Pull Requests:**
- Use a clear title summarizing the change
- Provide a brief description of what your code does and why
- Link to any related Issues
- Keep PRs focused — smaller is better

## 🔖 Labels and Boards

We use GitHub labels to help organize contributions. If your issue or PR relates to a specific category, feel free to tag it. There is also a GitHub Project Board to help track active work and priorities.

## 📣 Communication

Discussions are currently happening on GitHub — in Issues, PRs, and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Foundryborne/daggerheart/discussions). You're welcome to use any of these, though we may consolidate to one in the future.
