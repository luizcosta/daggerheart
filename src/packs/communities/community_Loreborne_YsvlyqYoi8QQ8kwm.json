Most members of these communities research in institutions built in bastions of civilization, while some eclectic few thrive in gathering information from the natural world. Some may be isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves, schools, or guilds and following their own unique ethos. Others still wield their knowledge on a larger scale, making deft political maneuvers across governmental landscapes.</p>\n<p class=\"green Body-Styles_Body\" chunk_id=\"b2a2e82d-a5de-43c7-b9b8-16b5bd8e5b8b\"><em>Loreborne are often direct, eloquent, inquisitive, patient, rhapsodic, and witty.</em></p></p>",
