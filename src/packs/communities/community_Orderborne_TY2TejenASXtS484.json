By aligning the members of their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling bodies of these enclaves are able to mobilize larger populations with less effort. While orderborne communities take a variety of forms—some even profoundly pacifistic—perhaps the most feared are those that structure themselves around military prowess. In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries.</p>\n<p class=\"green Body-Styles_Body\" chunk_id=\"6b261db5-6250-44a9-aebd-000cc9c9bcc5\"><em>Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.</em></p></p>",
