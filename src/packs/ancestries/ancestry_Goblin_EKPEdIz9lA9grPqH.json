    "description": "<p>Goblins are small humanoids easily recognizable by their large eyes and massive membranous ears.<br><br><p>With keen hearing and sharp eyesight, they perceive details both at great distances and in darkness, allowing them to move through less-optimal environments with ease. Their skin and eye colors are incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued, more dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between 3 feet and 4 feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size of their head. Goblins are known to use ear positions to very specific effect when communicating nonverbally. A goblinâ€™s lifespan is roughly 100 years, and many maintain their keen hearing and sight well into advanced age.</p></p>",
