    "description": "<p>Galapa resemble anthropomorphic turtles with large, domed shells into which they can retract.<br><br><p>On average, they range from 4 feet to 6 feet in height, and their head and body shapes can resemble any type of turtle. Galapa come in a variety of earth tones—most often shades of green and brown— and possess unique patterns on their shells. Members of this ancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs into their shell for protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive measures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength or appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs, but the process is exceedingly painful. Most galapa move slowly no matter their age, and they can live approximately 150 years.</p></p>",
